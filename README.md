# dude... Welcome

**dude... Welcome** is a minecraft modpack for 1.16.1 with a focus on exploration and engineering.

------------------------------

## Building the client/server.

You'll need **java** and **curl** installed. You'll also need to to install **packmaker** for python3 via pip: `sudo python3 -m pip install packmaker`.

### Client modpack distribution
The client modpack zip file that is uploaded to curseforge can be generated by running `./build-client.sh` 

### Server distribution
The server distribution zip file that is uploaded to curseforge can be generated by running `./build-server.sh`. 


------------------------------

## Updating Server Install

If you wish to keep your server updated using just this repo:

1. Update your repo: `git pull`
1. Build the latest server distribution: `./build-server.sh`
1. copy everything from the ./build/server/ folder over top of your server location: `cp -rf ./build/server/* ~/your/dudeWelcome/server/folder/`

## Modpack Credits

dude... Welcome was initially based off of [Valhelsia 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/valhelsia-3).
This repo makes heavy use of the python script [packmaker](https://packmaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/index.html).

Everything else done by me, NickPancakes.
